### Ingredients

Makes 4 portions

- 1 tsp Coriander Seed
- 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
- 2 tbsp Chipotle Paste (or some paprika)
- 4 Chicken Legs
- 3 large onions (ish)
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 8 Corn Tortillas
- 1 Lime

1. Toast the coriander seeds and cumin seeds in a dry frying pan, then coarsely grind in a pestle and mortar. Add the chipotle paste and a glug of oil and mix to a loose-ish paste.

2. Slash the skin of the chicken legs 4-5 times with a sharp knife. Rub with plenty of salt and the spice mix, then set aside.

3. Thinly slice 3/4 of the onions and the garlic. Preheat the oven to 220°C.

4. Set an ovenproof, flameproof casserole or roasting tray over a high heat. Add a glug of olive oil and the sliced onions with a big pinch of salt. Cook for 5 mins until starting to caramelise.

5. Add the garlic, stir through and sit the chicken on top along with all the marinade. Chuck the whole lot in the oven for 35-40 mins or until the skin is crispy and chicken is cooked through and tender.

6. Blend the tahini with the jalapeños, the coriander, a splash of jalapeno liquor and a splash of water. Season with salt and a squeeze of lime if needed.

7. Now, thinly slice the cabbage and onion, then add to a large mixing bowl. Pour over the tahini sauce and chuck in the remaining jalapenos. Roughly chop the remaining coriander and add to the bowl.

8. Toss everything together and add a squeeze of lime if necessary.

9. Heat your tortillas according to the pack instructions.

10. Pull your chicken out of the oven and rest for a couple of minutes. Shred the meat off the bone with a couple of forks.

11. Build your tacos up with plenty of the caramelised onions, pulled chicken, slaw and top with a squeeze of lime. Get stuck in.
