### Ingredients

- 500g beef steak
- 25g (3 tablespoons) cornflour
- a few good twists of black pepper
- 3 cloves of garlic, crushed
- ½ teaspoon finely grated ginger
- 120ml low-sodium soy sauce
- 25g brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon chilli flakes
- 3 spring onions, finely sliced

1. Place the beef on some kitchen paper and dry it off. Pop it into a bowl with the cornflour and pepper and toss until it is evenly covered, then set aside.
2. In a good non-stick pan, heat a little oil over a medium heat and gently cook the garlic and ginger until coloured, but be careful not to burn them. Add the soy sauce, brown sugar, chilli flakes and 120ml (4fl oz/ ½ cup) of water and cook until everything has thickened down nicely.
3. Pour the sauce into a jug. Put the beef straight into the same pan and cook on high until browned on all sides.
4. Pour the sauce over the beef and allow to bubble for a minute or 2.
5. Sprinkle the spring onions over the top and serve with rice and a smile.

**Note from Paul**

We can't stress enough about using low-sodium soy sauce - swap it for normal sodium soy sauce and you'll have a mouth saltier than a sailor's ankle.
