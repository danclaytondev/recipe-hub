# Pork Steaks with Apple and Sage

## Ingredients
- 4 pork steaks (approx 140g/5oz each), trimmed of excess fat
- 1 tbsp oil
- 2 eating apples, cored and cut into eight
- 1 onion, halved and sliced
- Small handful sage leaves, torn (or 2 tsp dried)
- 100ml chicken or ham stock (from a cube is fine)
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard or wholegrain mustard
- Salt and pepper to taste
- (optional) cornflour/potato starch to thicken

## Method
1. Rub the pork steaks with a little oil and season with pepper and salt to taste. Heat a large frying pan and fry the steaks for 2 mins on both sides until golden. Transfer to a plate.

2. Add a little more oil to the pan, fry the apples, onions and sage for 5 mins or until the apples have softened.

3. Pour in the stock and spoon in the mustard, then return the pork to the pan and simmer for 10 mins until the sauce has reduced by about a third and the pork is cooked through. Serve with veg and mashed potatoes.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
