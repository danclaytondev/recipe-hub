# Ingredients
Makes 6 decent size buns
## For the Dough:

120g warm milk (45 degrees C)
3.5g instant dry yeast, half a 7g pack
1 large egg
40g salted butter** (Melted or very softened, but make sure it isn't over 42C.)
50g granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt 
280g bread flour

## For the Filling:
57g salted butter (almost melted)
110g packed brown sugar 
1 tablespoons cinnamon
60g double cream*** (for pouring over the risen rolls)

## For the Frosting:
85g cream cheese (softened)
40g salted butter (softened)
120g powdered sugar
dash of vanilla extract

# Instructions
1. Pour the warm milk (45C) in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast overtop. Allow this to sit for 3-4 minutes. The yeast will get a little frothy to show it is activated. (120 g warm milk, the yeast)

2. Add the room temperature eggs, butter and sugar. Mix until combined. (1 large egg, 40g salted butter, 50 g granulated sugar)

3. Add in salt and most of the bread flour (save a bit add only if you need it) and mix using the beater blade just until the ingredients are barely combined. Allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes so the flour has time to soak up the liquids. (0.5 teaspoon salt, 280 g bread flour)

4. Scrape the dough off the beater blade and remove it. Attach the dough hook.

5. To knead, beat the dough on medium speed for 5-7 minutes, adding in up to 1/2 cup more flour only if needed to form a dough. The dough should be elastic and smooth. *The dough should be tacky and will pull away from the sides of the bowl but may stick slightly to the bottom. That's ok! Don't be tempted to add more flour at this point. We generally leave a little bit*

6. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Use a rubber spatula to remove the dough from the mixer bowl and place it in the greased large bowl. Cover the bowl with a towel or wax paper.

7. Set the bowl in a warm place and allow the dough to rise until double. I like to turn on the oven to the lowest setting for 1-2 minutes. Then turn off the oven and place the dough to rise in there. It normally takes about 30 minutes for the dough to rise. Do not allow the dough to rise too much or your cinnamon rolls will be airy.

8. While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling. In a medium bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. Set aside. (57 g salted butter, 110 g packed brown sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon)

9. Sprinkle a pastry mat or work surface generously with flour. Turn out the dough onto the surface and sprinkle the top of the dough with additional flour. 

10. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough to about a 60x40cm rectangle. (the size of the rectangle can vary...it does not have to be exact!)

11. Use a rubber spatula to smooth the cinnamon filling over the whole dough rectangle.

12. Starting on the long side, roll the dough up tightly jelly roll style. 

13. Cut into 6 slices and place in a greased baking pan.**** Cover the pan and allow the rolls to rise for 20 minutes while the oven is preheating.

14. Preheat the oven to 190C.

15. Warm the double cream until the chill is off. Don't make it hot...you just don't want it cold. It should be warm to the touch. Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls. (60g heavy cream)

16. Bake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes, until the rolls are lightly golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through. Note...the time will vary based on how big the rolls are, what type of pan, how close the rolls are packed, etc. They could take up to 30 minutes. Check the rolls at 20 minutes. If they are getting too browned, cover loosely with foil for the remaining baking time.

17. While the rolls are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting.

18. In a large bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and butter using a hand mixer. Blend well. (85g cream cheese, 40g salted butter)

19. Add in your extract and the powdered sugar. Beat until combined. Spread the frosting over the cooled rolls. (120 g powdered sugar)

# Notes
Notes:

*One packet of yeast is normally 7 grams. Different yeast calls for slightly different proofing methods. We follow Red Star Platinum's temperature guidelines. Please check your yeast packet to see what temperature the milk should be at.

**A note about the butter, we have used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/3 cup many times. We feel it keeps the rolls softer. Give it a try!

***If you don't have cream, use half and half, coffee creamer, evaporated milk, whole milk or coconut cream. Any of these will work. Even 2% milk will work, but we prefer a higher fat milk.

****For smaller rolls, cut the dough into 15 slices and use a larger baking pan. The larger pan will also allow the rolls to rise more evenly.

Our original recipe called for all-purpose flour, but we make them exclusively with bread flour now. Either will work, but bread flour yields a fluffier, sturdier roll with a slightly chewy texture. All-purpose flour gives a softer, more tender roll.

## Overnight Instructions
We often make the cinnamon rolls and get them to the point of the second rise (when they are rolled out, cut up and put in the pan). Cover and refrigerate until morning.
The morning you want to bake them, pull them out of the fridge. They may have doubled in size in the fridge overnight. If they have, let them sit for 30 minutes to get the chill off, then bake.
If they did not rise in the fridge overnight, allow them to rise at room temperature. Plan about at least an hour for this. Then pour on the cream and let them bake.
