## Ingredients:

### Marinade
* 700g diced skinless & boneless chicken breast (raw weight)
* 30ml soy sauce (Reduced Salt Soy Sauce)
* 1 tsp white and black pepper
* 5g minced garlic and 5g minced ginger
* 100g potato starch (approx. half sticks to the chicken)
### Sauce
* 35g light butter
* 1 diced garlic clove
* 75ml soy sauce
* 75ml water
* 30g brown sugar
* Red chili flakes (optional)
* 1 tsp cornstarch mixed with cold water
* 45g honey
* 700g cooked white rice (175g per serving)

## Instructions:

1. Add the diced chicken breast to a bowl, then mix in the soy sauce, white pepper, black pepper, minced garlic and minced ginger. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly.
2. Place the potato starch in a clean bowl and coat each piece of chicken evenly with the potato starch.
3. Place the chicken pieces on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and spray with a light cooking oil spray.
4. Cook chicken pieces in air fryer at 200C for 14-18 minutes or oven bake at 190C for 18-22 minutes. Flip the chicken half-way during cooking and spray again with the cooking oil spray if dry. Cook until the chicken is golden brown and crispy.
5. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the sauce. To a pan on low heat, add the butter, then add the diced garlic and saut√© until fragrant. Next, add the soy sauce, water, brown sugar and red chili flakes (optional). Mix in the cornstarch mixture to help the sauce thicken. Finally, add the honey and mix well, allowing the sauce to simmer until thickened.
6. Add the crispy chicken to the sauce in the pan and toss well until fully coated with the sauce.
7. Serve by dividing the honey butter chicken into 4 equal portions with 175g of cooked rice per serving. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped scallions. Enjoy!
