### Ingredients

- 125g fresh lasagne sheets
- 1 clove garlic
- ½ a bunch (15g) flat-leaf parsley
- olive oil
- 1 higher-welfare pork or veggie sausage
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- Chianti or other Italian red wine
- 200ml passata
- Parmesan cheese, for grating
- Optional: extra virgin olive oil

1. Boil the kettle. Cut the lasagne sheets lengthways into 3cm strips to make pappardelle. Peel and ﬁnely slice the garlic. Finely chop the top leafy half of the parsley, then the stalks, keeping them separate. Put a 28cm frying pan on a high heat.

2. Once hot, put a little drizzle of olive oil into the pan, then squeeze the sausage meat out of the skin into the pan, breaking it up with your spoon (if using a veggie sausage, crumble or slice). Fry and stir for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, parsley stalks and fennel seeds.
3. Once lightly golden, add a good splash of red wine, let it cook away, then add the passata and scatter the pasta into the pan. Carefully pour in enough boiling kettle water to just cover the pasta about 300ml. Let it bubble away for 4 minutes, or until the pasta has absorbed most of the water and you’ve got a nice rich sauce, stirring regularly and loosening with an extra splash of water, if needed.
4. Turn the heat off, stir in the parsley leaves, then season to perfection. Finish with a grating of Parmesan and a kiss of extra virgin olive oil, if you like.
