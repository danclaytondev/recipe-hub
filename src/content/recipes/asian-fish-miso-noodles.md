### Ingredients

- ### Fish
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 300g salmon fillet, skin off and pin boned
- 300g of any white fish fillet, skin off and pin boned
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds
- 1 lime
- 1 tbsp runny honey
- 2 springs fresh coriander
- ### Noodles
- 1 x 15g sachet of miso paste
- 2 tbsp low-salt soy sauce, plus extra to serve
- 5 dried kaffir lime leaves
- 3 nests of fine egg noodles
- 1 fresh red chilli
- ½ a cucumber
- 200g sugar snap peas
- 4 spring onions
- 1 little gem lettuce
- 200g radishes
- 1 lime
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

### Recipe

- Preheat your oven to 200 C
- Rub half the sesame oil on a small shallow baking dish or ovenproof serving platter.
- Pat both fish dry with kitchen paper, slice them into 1.5 cm-thick strips and arrange randomly around the dish or platter. Cut the Salmon slightly thicker as it tends to cool a little quicker than the white fish.
- Rub gently with the rest of the sesame oil, sprinkle with the sesame seeds and season with salt and pepper.
- Scatter over half the lime juice, then drizzle over the honey.
- Place in the oven to cook through (about 7 minutes)
- Pour 1 litre of boiling water into a casserole pan with the miso paste, soy sauce, crumbled lime leaves and noodles, making sure they’re fully submerged. Slice the chilli and add to the broth.
- Finely slice the cucumber. Sugar snaps, trimmed spring onions, lettuce and radishes in a food processor.
- Tip the sliced veg into a bowl and dress with the juice of 1 lime, a little soy sauce and the extra olive oil.
- Check the noodles and switch off the heat when they’re done, drain most of the excess liquid, leaving some. Season to taste with soy sauce.
- Pile the veg in the centre of the noodles and toss together at the table.
- Serve the fish sprinkled with coriander leaves.
