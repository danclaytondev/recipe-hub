### Ingredients

- 4 ripe bananas
- 125g butter + for greasing
- 250g self-raising flour
- 200g caster sugar
- 3 medium eggs
- 3 tbsp golden syrup

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Butter a large loaf tin.
2. Peel the bananas and put them into a food processor. Blend for 10 seconds to break them up.
3. Add all the other ingredients and blend again for 10 seconds. Scrape down the sides and blend again for a few seconds to mix everything in.
4. Spoon the mixture into the buttered loaf tin and spread evenly. Bake for 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours, until well risen and firm to the touch. At this point, insert a small knife to test the cake; if it is pulled out clean and the tip is not wet, then the cake is ready.
5. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes before turning out of the tin and placing on a wire rack to cool a little. Serve the cake warm.
